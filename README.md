# Password-Generator-App

To use this app, click the 'generate password' button. 

It will prompt you to pick a password length between 10 and 64 characters. If you choose a number less than 10 or greater than 64, or if you input something that isn't an integer, the app will prompt you to choose the length under the correct parameters. 

Next, you will select character types: lowercase, uppercase, numeric or special characters. You must choose at least one character type, and you must only input 'y' for yes or 'n' for no. If you do not select a character type or if you input anything other than 'y' or 'n', you will be prompted to select character types again. 

Once successful, your password will be generated ready to copy, paste and use.
